<femakita> I have actually been assigned to find out the president of the three stooges fan club (and document my reference process)
<femakita> It's never a good sign when Brendan has an OS in his nick
<femakita> Despite the euphemism, that doesn't count as 'eating out'
<femakita> Seriously, would you want to watch most callahanians having group sex with 3 friends?
<femakita> Also, no offense, if I wanted to watch you having sex I'd probably just have sex with you again
<femakita> Well, it got enough out it doesn't show on the outside, and anyone who's looking at the inside of the crotch of my jeans gets what they deserve

<femakita> You look really goofy having sex with your head shaved.

<BassBone> You know, getting your semen swallowed isn't so much of a much. Once it's out of me I don't really care where it goes.
<SebastesMan> AuntieEn: I'm poorer than emofrog's attitude.
<WerknDog> You'd think they'd get tired of the taste after a while.
<AuntieEn> Semen has protein, rofl. <ManinBlak> Otherwise, yeah, they're empty calories :P
<BreakDog> Might just as well lube me with epoxy and insert a cork.
<ManinBlak> Jay, I love ya man, but I ain't gonna use most of the folks in this channel as a yardstick of normal :P
<AuntieEm> Just be glad elfi and I never fucked.

<redfrog> Ugh i made a really stupid mistake, Ii failed to ask out a woman that would have been perfect for me<redfrog> Now i will never see her again<Timedoc> She got back in her spaceship & went home?

<^elfi^> Bren: yes, and we thank you SO much for that<^elfi^> for our lives were blighted and dull before we saw your dick
<AuntieEm> I like it sticky.
<femakita> You know the phrase 'God's gift to women'?<femakita> Someone said 'I wonder what God's return policy is.'
<KOI_> BassBone: No. I'm sort of not sure if I should be aroused, upset, or jealous.
<femakita> elfi: Mostly I don't have eyes inside my snatch.
<Liera> Oh baby! Just what I always wanted, lesbian incest!
* Corwin will browse porn at work, but not torrent sites...
<Corwin> Nothin like heating razor-thin slices of an Oscar Mayer in your folded tinfoil spoon...<Corwin> Simmered in mustard...
<SebastesMan> Penis.<katarin> That looks neat<katarin> But there is a better one out there..
<^elfi^> Cock isn't the only thing in the world :P<femakita> it's not?
<BassBone> But I love my pussy.
<BassBone> Can't masturbate with this cat on my lap.
<femakita> Woo hoo, I get to bug Flaim!<femakita> You KNOW that's one of my hobbies.
<SebastesMan> Masturbation is a handy way to prevent blueballs.<AuntieEm> I did it like 8 times in a row.
<Drayno> I am having SERIOUS issues with spell checkers.<Drayno> I was really proud of myself ... until I realized the next day I was so chafed I couldn't walk.
<^elfi^> I was wrong.
<LizziKnittin> I'd rather not have sex with a barnacle.<LizziKnittin> They뭨e not to my taste.
<Marguerit> You know, the world would be better if they let this channel rule it. LOL
<^elfi^> I lie
<AuntieEm> This is supposed to be one of those things good for my heart, right?<Oberon-> If you've got one. ;-)
<FreeTrav> BTW, what kind of computer are you attached to?<ToraKuma> Dummy.
* AuntieEn has a Hard Penis
<Corwin> Hm. 75 * 365.25 * 30... so over 75 years you'd have spend 9 and a half days cleaning your cock.
<FreeTrav> Terrorism doesn't involve handing piles of zucchini to your neighbors. Gardening is far scarier.
<kuru> Best scene in the show, IMO, is Mal naked on that rock.<Corwin> lol<rain_man> oh gawd, yes.
<Beki> Pau has gotten a girlfriend and a bit of a lie.
<Zedidiah_> If we didn't want whoever's side we joined to slap us on the back and go 'YEAH, THE OTHER GUY EATS COCKS LOLOL.'
<Ororo> Does it get more plush if you rub it?
<AuntieEn> Dude, if you can get a Cenarian Herb Bag at WalMart, I'll suck your dick.
<SebastesMan> I'll always wear clothes.... ugly people should always be clothed.
<rain_man> Y'know, the fact that kbeetl is familiar enough with the taste of the Etch-a-Sketch powder that he can tell that it's changed over the years. . . well, that says a lot.<rain_man> It explains a great deal about kbeetl.
<Keemo> Onions, Saurkraut, ketchup, mustard and Vagisil on a hot dog.<Corwin> Yea, no kidding. Ketchup on hotdogs is a travesty.
<Corwin> Oh, i dunno, you've never had my mom's turkey... that *might* be called murder.
<femakita> See, I talk about more penis than necessary, and Brendan shows up >:)
* femakita is gonna guess it involves someone crapping in a jar, and saves the effort of loading the page by just letting herself visualize and moving on.
<femakita> I'm the poster child for being idle on IRC.
<AuntieEm> You know, most people work on having a sense of {humour;} BearCloud is the only one I know of that works on having a sense of dumb.
<AuntieEm> Yeah, but does anyone *really* wanna have to eat 42 yards of asshole?
<ToraKuma> Hmm guess there's only one thing to do, yep put the supid bot back on ignore just like the asshat owner.<AuntieEn> Actually, the owner is ManInBlak.
<rain_man> Jewish girl calls home and says, 'Mom & Dad, I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is - I've met the love of my life. I'm going to marry a doctor!' 'Oh! Oh! My baby's gonna marry a Doctor! What could possibly be the bad news?'<rain_man> 'She's a Gentile.'

<^elfi^> Sam's got 75 inches and nice and thick<femakita> HOLY SHIT
<Nocturne4Evr> Well, in my defense, I had smoked like 3 joints of Peruvian weed when I tried the spybot/sdoctor bit first.
<kbeetl> 'this cunt is way too salty'
<Da5id> Also, I don't lick my own hands for a reason.
*** femakita (~femakita@femakita.users.undernet.org) has left IRC (Quit: Read error: Connection reset by peeg)<kbeetl> Well... looks like this cunt has run its course
<kbeetl> I look at 44DD every night.<MildBill> kbeetl: Ever considered reduction surgery for manboobs that size?
<KOI_> What does Satan prefer?<Oberon> Miracle Whip on Windows.
<Nocturne4Evr> Yeah, luckily I've never mentioned that time I got really drunk and punked a guinea pig that had on a spiked collar.
<Nocturne4Evr> I state for the record I have never actually had sexual relations with animals.<Nocturne4Evr> That was just a flippant comment, and you entrapped me.

Oh well time to look elsewhere for my amusement )
<zedidiah> You're all satan.
<zedidiah> Someone managed to shit a sandy vagina into your cornflakes, from all I can tell.
<HawkWould> Oh no no no ... I'm almost as big an asshole as you are.
<^elfi^> Brendan is as tenacious as a Jehovah's Witness pit bull.<AuntieEm> 'Here, take this free Watchtower...GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR'
<Simsy> Have I walked into a discussion on the merits of pig fat?
<Marguerit> Adam, yes, I think I'd have to agree that more cowbell would not help your situation at this time.
* ^elfi^ is glad they left your asshole its standard size ;)
<kuru> How many wives you have had?<Flaim> More than he's been married to... heh
<AuntieEm> Masturbating around the dog is safe, he just looks at you like 'Dude, you're doing it wrong' and then licks himself.
^elfi-^> I was wrong.
<^elfi^> We all know you fantasize about my blubbery ass every night.
* @Flaim is distinctly not a fucker this weekend.<@Flaim> Unless you count my right hand.

<KOI> kuru: Never heard of that one. Do you suppose wikipedia has a diagram?<kuru> a diagram of cock up the ass?
<katarin> I wonder how much stuph it'd take to fill a terabyte drive.<Corwin> A terabyte.
SebastesMan lies loudly<Nightshade-> Yes, we've noticed.
<kbeetl> 'Let's eat out Grandma,' he said, forgetting his punctuation.
<kuru> Flaim would probably help me wax the floor if I let him :P<DouglasK> kuru: He'd do anything to get you on your hands and knees.
<@^Da5id^> Man... having one's own business means never having to apologize for fucking the gf in the office.
-!- Amirence is now known as AuntieEm<Corwin> OK, what'd you break?
<kuru> Tonight hopefully I will dream about what an amazingly fine looking man Alexander Skarsgard is, and in my dreams he has a 2 inch thick 9 inch long dick which he's happy to let me play with whenever and however I want, unless he's otherwise sticking that dick in me for fun and amusement.<Murrlin> sounds owie
<Flaim> In other shocking news, I like tits.
<Flaim> Heh. A full 10% of my quotes in Mike contain 'tits'.
<rain_man> You know you're a bigoted loser when even the KKK has no use for you.
<Callahan> -- AuntieEm Exposed on Inside Edition as Spawn of Bob Dole!<Flaim> No surprise there, either. :)

<AuntieEm> You guys are making my ass itch.
<BassBone> Dammit? Why do I talk about my ass so much?
<kbeetl> I haven't farted in... oops, nevermind.
<Cygnata> So yes, to quote several people, I *am* a 'fucking idiot' for walking 4 miles before a 10 hour day at work, but I'll be fine with rest :P

<^elfi^> Jesus, I'm really fucking profane. :P
<Nocturne4Evr> Great, the drive thinks it's a Dynamic volume and won't let me convert it.<Nocturne4Evr> I had to use a disk-hex editor to modify the goddamn value. And the funny part, is the answer to the solution is 42.
<femakita> I just got pwned by my own uterus.
Nocturne4Evr> I have created the ultimate XP Pro SP3 multi-boot DVD-R.. By changing every single thing in the OS, disabling local writes (recycle bin, drive restore, indexing) and relocating everything else to a directory, I can reboot onto a Win XP SP3 OS that lets me run games and pretty much anything else, and doesn't require the OS to be writable except to the relocated folders. It can't be damaged!
* FaithW-- thinks she is going to have to separate Da5id and elfi . . .or turn the channel around and go home.
